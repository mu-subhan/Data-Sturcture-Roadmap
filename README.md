# Data-Sturcture-Roadmap
Before Start DSA journey Reminder following steps

❌ Don't spend more than 40 to 50 minutes on a problem. Learn from the most upvoted solutions after 60 minutes and move on.

❌ Don't try Leetcode mediums in the beginning. Start with easy problems and slowly progress towards medium problems. 

❌ Don't worry about Leetcode hards. Most problems asked in the interviews are medium difficulty. 

❌ Don't try to optimize your code for total lines of code. Optimize for readability (and big-O).


✅ Time yourself. If you can't solve a problem in less than 45 minutes, you will not be able to solve it in an interview.

✅ Always read the top 3 most upvoted solutions. Even if you manage to solve a problem, there's a good chance someone else has solved it better than you. 

✅ Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone starts from zero.. Keep going!
